Two simple steps:

	python3 setup.py build

and then to install

	python3 setup.py install

You can install in your home directory instead

	python3 setup.py install --home ~

Be sure you have libdvdread4 installed and working. Obtaining and installing this library is outside the scope of this module and documentation.
